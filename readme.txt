Clones an existing site into a new one in a multisite installation : copies all the posts, settings and files

== Description ==

MultiSite Clone Duplicator adds a "Duplicate Site" functionnality to your network installation. It allows you to clone any site of your network into a new one : all data, files, users and roles can be copied. It is usefull when you want to create multiple sites from a same template : do not waste your time on copy the same configuration again and again ! Simple and user-friendly, this plugin extends WordPress core network's functionalities without polluting the dashboard.

= Features: =
* Clones any site of your wordpress multisite installation
* Copies all the posts and settings
* Generates log files (if option is checked)
* Copy all files from duplicated site (if option is checked)
* Keep users and roles from duplicated site (if option is checked)
* Configure which site is clonable (so you can define an unique "pattern" site)
* Fully hookable

== Installation ==

You can install MultiSite Clone Duplicator using the built in WordPress plugin installer. It’s easy, 2 seconds.

If you prefer download MultiSite Clone Duplicator manually :

1. Upload multisite-clone-duplicator/ to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. (Optional) Chmod 777 the logs/ directory of the plugin, if you want to activate logs

In the future, you'll probably want to create a dedicated "template" blog to clone from.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work ? =
Basically :
* it creates a new user if the email was not an existing email
* it creates a new blog with appropriate title and admin user
* it copy all tables from cloned site, but keep some options (like title, domain, etc) of the new blog
* it searches and replaces old site's URL and DOMAINS with the new ones
* it copies upload directory from the old site to the upload directory of the new one (if option is checked)
* it import users and roles from the old site to the new one (if option is checked)

= Does it support subdirectory AND subdomain installations ? = 
Yes, it supports both !

= Can I clone the primary site ? = 
Yes you can, but you want to be carrefully : WordPress saves network tables and primary blog tables with the same prefix, and some of their data are mixed. It forces us to restrict primary blog cloning to copy only the default wp tables. If you want to change this (for example, include your plugin tables in the clonage), use mucd_default_primary_tables_to_copy filter. In the future, you want probably not to copy again and again the primary blog : use a "template" blog dedicated to clonage instead.

= Does it clone plugins settings ? = 
Yes it does !

= But some data are serialized ? =
It's not a problem ! Serialized data are understood by the plugin, recursively unserialized, replaced with appropriate values, and serialized again.

= After cloning, new site was created, but it goes on 404 page non found, why ? =
Check your host / server configuration : you probably cloned your site into a domain that is not available !

= Which languages are currently supported? = 
As of now, MultiSite Clone Duplicator is available in English and in French. If you wish to, you can translate the interface in your own language in the [standard WordPress way](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress)
